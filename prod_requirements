1. Overview
Product Name: My Notes App
Purpose: A super simple notes app that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes. Each note is tagged with a hashtag-based category (e.g., #work, #personal) and is appended with a date automatically. Users can filter notes by hashtag category or by date to quickly find relevant information.

2. Objectives
Simplicity: Provide an intuitive, minimal interface where users can manage notes without extra features such as comments or complex folder structures.
Organization: Enable users to categorize notes using hashtags and quickly filter by date or tag.
Scalability: Built using modern, serverless-friendly technologies (Next.js + Supabase) with secure authentication (Clerk).
3. User Roles & Use Cases
3.1 User Roles
Authenticated User: Can create, edit, delete, and filter notes. Users must be signed in to see and manage their own notes.
Unauthenticated User: Can only see a login/signup screen. They do not have access to any notes.
3.2 Primary Use Cases
Create a Note: User enters note text, selects or adds a new hashtag category. The note automatically stores the current date/time.
View All Notes: User sees a list of their notes in chronological order (or any default sorting), with each note showing its text, date, and hashtag.
Filter by Hashtag: Selecting a hashtag (e.g., #work) shows only notes tagged with #work.
Filter by Date: User can filter notes by a chosen date range or single date.
Edit a Note: User can modify the text or change the hashtag.
Delete a Note: User can remove a note permanently.
4. Features
4.1 Notes Management
Create New Note

Fields: Note text (multi-line text), Hashtag category (text input or dropdown).
Automatically capture current date and time (to store within the note’s metadata in Supabase).
Read Notes

Display a scrollable list of notes with the most recent note on top (or user’s preferred sort order).
Each note shows:
Text snippet
Date/time created (or last edited if you prefer)
Hashtag category (e.g., #bear)
Edit Notes

Users can update the text and hashtag of existing notes.
Delete Notes

A delete button or context action to remove the note from the database.
4.2 Filtering & Sorting
Filter by Hashtag

A side menu or clickable list of hashtags (e.g., on the left) to filter notes.
Clicking a hashtag only displays notes with that hashtag.
Filter by Date

A simple date picker or date range input to filter notes by creation date.
Optional: Provide a “Today,” “This Week,” “This Month,” or “All Time” quick filter.
4.3 Authentication
Sign Up / Log In
Handled by Clerk (username/password, social login, etc. depending on your Clerk configuration).
Secure session management so only the user’s notes are displayed once logged in.
5. User Interface Requirements
Layout:

A simple layout with a left sidebar for hashtags and filters (similar to Bear’s categories pane).
Main content area for the notes list and a button for creating new notes.
Notes List:

Each note in the list shows a short preview (first lines of text), the date, and the hashtag label.
Clicking on a note lets users expand/edit the full text.
Create/Edit Form:

A pop-up modal or a form at the top of the screen that includes:
Multi-line text input
Hashtag input/dropdown
Save or Update button
Styling:

Use Tailwind CSS for quick and consistent styling.
Keep it minimal (whitespaces, clean lines, readable font sizes).
6. Technical Requirements
Frontend:

Framework: Next.js for server-side rendering and performance.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS.
Backend & Database:

Supabase
Used as the primary database for storing user notes.
Real-time or RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on notes.
Integration with row-level security to ensure each user only accesses their own notes.
Authentication:

Clerk for user authentication, session management, and user profile handling.
APIs:

Create a set of Next.js API routes or use Supabase’s built-in endpoints.
Example routes:
POST /api/notes → Create new note
GET /api/notes?hashtag=...&date=... → Read/filter notes
PUT /api/notes/{id} → Update note
DELETE /api/notes/{id} → Delete note
Deployment:

Deploy on a platform that easily integrates with serverless functions (e.g., Vercel) or any environment supported by Next.js and Supabase.
7. Non-Functional Requirements
Security:
Must ensure that only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on their notes.
Performance:
Quick load times for the notes list (caching or SSR as appropriate).
Scalability:
Ability to handle a growing user base, with Supabase and Next.js scaling seamlessly.
Reliability:
Automatic backups or versions of the Supabase database.
Usability:
Straightforward, minimalistic UX with easily discoverable features (filters, new note creation, etc.).
Maintainability:
Code structured in a clear, modular way.
Make use of Next.js and Tailwind best practices.
8. Milestones & Roadmap
MVP (Core Functionality)
Set up Next.js with Tailwind.
Integrate Clerk for authentication (sign up/in).
Integrate Supabase and create “Notes” table (fields: id, user_id, text, hashtag, created_at).
Implement pages:
Login/Sign up
Notes List (with create/edit/delete)
Filtering by hashtag and date
Post-MVP Enhancements
Pagination or infinite scrolling.
More advanced filtering (e.g., multiple hashtags, date ranges).
Sorting options (e.g., alphabetical, oldest first).
Rich text or markdown support for notes (if desired).
Mobile-friendly responsive UI enhancements.
9. Success Metrics
User Retention: Number of returning daily/weekly users.
Number of Notes Created: Total notes created per user over time.
Low Error Rate: Minimal 4xx or 5xx errors from the API.
Feedback: Positive user feedback on simplicity and usability.
10. Risks & Mitigations
User Data Security:
Use secure authentication (Clerk) and properly secure Supabase database with row-level security.
Performance Bottlenecks:
Use Next.js for server-side rendering and efficient fetching with Supabase.
Feature Creep:
Clearly define an MVP and limit new features until the core functionality is stable.
